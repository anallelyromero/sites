    <h1 class="US"> Explosion at Texas FedEx Plant Is Fifth Attack Linked to Austin Serial Bomber</h1>
<p> A package that exploded just after midnight on Tuesday at a FedEx distribution center in Schertz, Texas, is likely connected to the four recent package bombs in Austin, federal agents say.

The San Antonio Texas Fire Department said the package explosion injured one FedEx employee, who suffered a non-threatening “percussion-type” injury, the Associated Press reports. FBI agents say that the bomb and the previous attacks in Austin are likely linked by a suspected serial bomber.

FBI San Antonio spokeswoman Michelle Lee told CNN that based on preliminary reports, the latest bombing was connected to the first four attacks.

“We suspect it is related to our investigation,” Lee said.

Austin’s Chief of Police Brian Manley took to social media following the latest package bombing. He posted a statement and urged local residents to remain “vigilant.”</p>
<p> “The Austin Police Department is aware of the incident that has occurred in Schertz, Texas, and is working closely on the investigation with our federal partners,” he tweeted.

“I want to continue to remind our community to pay close attention to any suspicious device whether it be a package, a bag, a backpack or anything that looks out of place, do not approach it,” he added.</p>

<p> Two people have died so far as a result of the bombings, while five have now been injured, including the FedEx employee. 39-year-old Anthony House died on March 2, while 17-year-old Draylen Mason died on March 12. The first bomb in the series took place on March 2, followed by two more bombings on March 12 and another on March 18, which seriously injured two.

Authorities have yet to identify a suspect in the Austin bombings. </p>

    <h1 class="US"> Tornadoes Damage Homes and Caused Power Outages Across the U.S. Southeast</h1>

<p> (ATLANTA) — Severe storms that spawned tornadoes damaged homes and downed trees as they moved across the Southeast on Monday night.

Forecasters warned that the storms could threaten more than 29 million people, raising the risk of powerful tornadoes, damaging winds and hail the size of tennis balls.

Cities in northern Alabama reported power outages, and the National Weather Service in Huntsville reported at least three confirmed tornadoes in the area.

In Limestone County, an Alabama county on the Tennessee border, the sheriff’s office posted photos online of houses with roofs ripped off and outbuildings torn from their foundations. Several roads were closed because of power lines or trees, the office tweeted. But it had no reports of injuries from the storms.</p>
<p> The athletic director at Jacksonville State University said late Monday there was significant damage to the campus.

“I can confirm we have major roof damage at Pete Mathews Coliseum, but The Pete is not completely destroyed,” Greg Seitz said in a tweet.

Portions of northern Alabama and southern Tennessee were still under tornado warnings Monday night, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for much of northern Georgia as the line moved eastward.

Forecasters said the storm threat is unusually dangerous because of the possibility of several tornadoes, some of which could be intense. The weather service says hail as large as 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter could fall, and there’s a possibility of wind gusts to 70 mph (115 kph). </p>
<p>“The potential for strong to violent, long-track tornadoes is a real possibility,” Alabama state meteorologist Jim Stefkovic said at a news conference.

Alabama Emergency Management Executive Operations Officer Jeff Smitherman raised the threat level and increased staffing at Alabama’s emergency management agency. The storms are the first severe weather to threaten the state this year.

School systems from central Tennessee as far south as Birmingham, Alabama, let out early, hoping students and staff would have time to get home before the storms moved through.

The threatened storms come one day before the official start of spring, and are “by far the most impressive setup we’ve seen so far this year,” said Kurt Weber, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama. </p>
<p> “We can’t rule out a strong tornado east of Interstate 65 at this point with all the ingredients coming together,” Weber added. “Hopefully not, but definitely a possibility.”

He said golf ball to tennis ball-sized hail, which can do serious damage to buildings and cars, was possible.

“This is one of those days you want to put the car in the garage if you can,” Weber said.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey urged Alabamians to implement safety plans and get in a safe location.

“We are not taking the situation lightly,” Ivey said. “Severe weather is unpredictable and that is why it is paramount we prepare ahead of time.”

The University of Alabama suspended operations Monday from 6:30 p.m. to midnight, meaning classes and campus activities were cancelled, libraries closed and shelters were opened on campus.</p>

<h1 class="US">   The Florida Shooting Suspect's Younger Brother Has Been Arrested </h1>

<p> (MIAMI) — The brother of the teen charged with killing 17 people at a Florida school was arrested Monday afternoon for trespassing at the same school, authorities said.

Zachary Cruz, 18, was arrested at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and charged with trespassing on school grounds, a Broward Sheriff’s Office report said.

The teen was recorded by security cameras riding his skateboard at the school around 4:30 p.m. though he had received prior warnings from school officials to stay away from the campus, the report said.

Zachary Cruz told the arresting deputy that he was there to “reflect on the school shooting and to soak it in,” according to the report. It added that the teen had “surpassed all locked doors and gates and proceeded to ride his skateboard through school grounds.”</p>
<p>The youth’s brother, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder in connection with the Feb. 14 shooting.
  The Associated Press reported Sunday that documents show some officials recommended in September 2016 that Nikolas Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation, though the recommendation was never acted upon. Such a commitment would have made it more difficult, if not impossible, for Cruz to have legally obtained a gun such as the AR-15 assault-style rifle used in the shooting.

  Jail records didn’t immediately list an attorney for Zachary Cruz.
